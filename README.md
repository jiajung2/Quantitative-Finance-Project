•	For the Quantitative Finance Project, 

I choose to analyze the performance level of Tesla Company and compare its performance with other traditional companies after Covid Period. I first constructed and compared two stocks' important statistics measurement of Sharpe ratio after the covid period,and took four different hypothesis tests to assess correlation parameters, performance dependence. Also I applied CAPM model and Fama-French four factor analysis to determine stock's return and volatility level in metrics of Alpha, Beta coefficient for finding out the reason for excessive return compared to the market level and finally ran Monte Carlo simulation method for historical return assessment
